# Homemade-python

Every once in a while I write a new script that solves a problem that would take more time than desirable.
The main objetive is to gain experience as I write more and more "problem solvers".

| Name              | Use                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| prefixRemover.py  | Removes substring from filenames  |
